// COMMON NOTATIONS

/*

O-Notation (Big O):

O(f(n))
Explanation: Represents the upper bound or worst-case time complexity of an algorithm. It provides an asymptotic upper limit on the growth rate of the algorithm's running time concerning the input size.
Example: If an algorithm is O(n^2), it means the running time grows quadratically with the input size.
Ω-Notation (Big Omega):

Ω(f(n))
Explanation: Represents the lower bound or best-case time complexity of an algorithm. It provides an asymptotic lower limit on the growth rate of the algorithm's running time concerning the input size.
Example: If an algorithm is Ω(n), it means the running time grows at least linearly with the input size.
Θ-Notation (Theta):

Θ(f(n))
Explanation: Represents the tight or average-case time complexity of an algorithm. It provides both upper and lower bounds, indicating that the growth rate is neither faster nor slower than the specified function.
Example: If an algorithm is Θ(n), it means the running time grows linearly with the input size, and it is both the best and worst-case scenario.
o-Notation (Small O):

o(f(n))
Explanation: Represents an upper bound that is not tight. It signifies that the growth rate of the algorithm's running time is strictly less than the specified function.
Example: If an algorithm is o(n^2), it means the running time grows strictly slower than quadratic with the input size.
ω-Notation (Small Omega):

ω(f(n))
Explanation: Represents a lower bound that is not tight. It signifies that the growth rate of the algorithm's running time is strictly greater than the specified function.
Example: If an algorithm is ω(n), it means the running time grows strictly faster than linear with the input size.
