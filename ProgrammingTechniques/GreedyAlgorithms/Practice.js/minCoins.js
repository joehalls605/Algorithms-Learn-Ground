// A greedy algorithm is an approach to problem-solving that makes the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. 

// Scenario: We have a set of coins of different values, and we want to find the minimum number of coins needed to make a certain amount of money.

function minCoins(coins, amount) { 
    // Sort the coins array in descending order to ensure that we use the largest possible coins first.
    coins.sort((a, b) => b - a); // Sorts the coins array in descending order
    
    let numCoins = 0; // Variable to store the total number of coins used
    let remainingAmount = amount; // Variable to keep track of the remaining amount of money to make

    for (let i = 0; i < coins.length; i++) { // Iterate through each coin denomination
        const coin = coins[i]; // Get the value of the current coin denomination
        
        // Calculate how many coins of this denomination can be used
        const count = Math.floor(remainingAmount / coin); // Calculate the maximum number of whole coins that can be used without exceeding the remaining amount
        
        // Update the total number of coins used
        numCoins += count; // Add the count of coins of this denomination to the total number of coins used
        
        // Update the remaining amount after using these coins
        remainingAmount -= count * coin; // Deduct the total value of coins used from the remaining amount
        
        // If remainingAmount becomes 0, we've found the solution and can exit the loop
        if (remainingAmount === 0) {
            break; // Exit the loop since we've achieved the target amount
        }
    }

    return numCoins; // Return the total number of coins used to make the target amount
}

// Example usage:
const coins = [25, 10, 5, 1]; // Denominations of coins
const amount = 47; // Amount of money to make
console.log("Minimum number of coins needed:", minCoins(coins, amount)); // Output the minimum number of coins needed to make the target amount

// This algorithm is a greedy algorithm because it makes locally optimal choices at each step without considering the entire problem space. 
// It iterates through the available coin denominations, selecting the largest denomination that can be used without exceeding the remaining amount of money. 
// By selecting the largest possible coins at each step, it aims to minimize the total number of coins used, with the hope of finding the optimal solution.
