1. Read and Analyze the Problem Statement:
We are to write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the numbers in the array.

2. Clarify Ambiguities:
There don't seem to be any ambiguities in this problem. We just need to sum up the numbers in the array.

3. Break Down the Problem:
Input:
An array of numbers

Output:
A single number representing the sum

We need to loop through the array and add up all the numbers

4. Identify similar problems:
Similar problems could be  finding the maximum or minimum number in an array, or calculating the average of numbers in an array.

5. Constraints and complexity:
There are no constraints for this task but I aim for a efficient solution.

6. Brain storm approach:
I could use a simple for loop that iterates over each element in the array and adds it to a running total

7. Evaluate feasbility and trade offs:
This approach should be feasible for small-moderate arrays, but larger arrays would require an optimised solution.

8. Choose an approach:
Chose the loop iteration approach

9. Design an algorithm:

Initialise a variable 'sum' to 0
Iterate over each element 'num' in the array
Add 'num' to 'sum'
After looping through all elements return 'sum'

Sudo code:

sum = 0;
for each num in array
    sum = sum + num
    return sum
