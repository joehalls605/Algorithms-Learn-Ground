We are to write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the numbers in the array.

2. Clarify Ambiguities:
There don't seem to be any ambiguities in this problem. We just need to sum up the numbers in the array.

3. Break Down the Problem:
Input:
An array of numbers

Output:
A single number representing the sum

We need to loop through the array and add up all the numbers
