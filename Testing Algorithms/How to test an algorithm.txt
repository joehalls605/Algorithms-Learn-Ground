### 1. **Define Objectives:**

- Clearly state the purpose of the algorithm and what it's supposed to accomplish. What problem does it solve?

### 2. **Identify Test Cases:**

- Break down the algorithm's functionality into smaller units.
- For each unit, identify inputs, expected outputs, and any boundary cases.

### 3. **Design Test Data:**

- Create a set of test data that covers various scenarios, including normal, boundary, and exceptional cases.
- Ensure that test data is comprehensive enough to validate all aspects of the algorithm's functionality.

### 4. **Create Test Procedures:**

- Outline the steps to execute each test case, including how to set up initial conditions and any specific actions needed to perform the test.

### 5. **Determine Expected Results:**

- Define what the output of each test case should be. This includes expected values, error messages, or any other relevant outcomes.

### 6. **Execute Tests:**

- Follow the test procedures to run each test case against the algorithm.
- Record the actual results of each test.

### 7. **Analyse Results:**

- Compare the actual results with the expected results for each test case.
- Identify any discrepancies or failures.

### 8. **Iterate and Retest:**

- If any failures are found, debug the algorithm and repeat the testing process until all issues are resolved.
