1. Objective:
Verify that the findLargestNumber function correctly identifies the largest number in a given array.

2. Identify Test Cases:
Basic case: Test with an array where the largest number is in the middle.
Largest number at the beginning of the array.
Largest number at the end of the array.
Test with negative numbers.
Test with an empty array.
Test with an array containing only one element.
Test with an array containing duplicate largest numbers.
Test with a large array.

3. Design Test Data:
Prepare test arrays corresponding to each test case identified in step 2.

4. Create Test Procedures:
Define steps to execute each test case using the findLargestNumber function.
Verify the output against the expected result.

5. Determine Expected Results:
For each test case, determine what the largest number should be based on the input array.

6. Execute Tests:
Run each test case using the defined test data and procedures.
Record the actual results.

7. Analyze Results:
Compare the actual results with the expected results for each test case.
Identify any discrepancies or failures.

Example Test Plan:

Test Cases:
Basic Case:
Input: [1, 4, 7, 8, 9]
Expected Output: 9

Largest Number at the Beginning:
Input: [9, 4, 7, 8, 1]
Expected Output: 9

Largest Number at the End:
Input: [1, 4, 7, 8, 9]
Expected Output: 9

Test with Negative Numbers:
Input: [-5, -2, -10, -3]
Expected Output: -2

Test with Empty Array:
Input: []
Expected Output: undefined (or any specific handling for empty arrays)
Test with Single Element:
Input: [5]
Expected Output: 5

Test with Duplicate Largest Numbers:
Input: [3, 8, 8, 2, 5, 8]
Expected Output: 8
Test with Large Array:
Input: Array with a large number of elements (e.g., 10,000 elements)
Expected Output: [Expected largest number]

Test Procedures:
Run the findLargestNumber function with each input array.
Compare the output with the expected result for each test case.
Analysis:
If the actual output matches the expected output for all test cases, the function is working correctly.
If any test case fails, investigate the cause of failure and make necessary adjustments to the function.
